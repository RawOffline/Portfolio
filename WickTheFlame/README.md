You lost your little brother in a dark cave... find him! <br> <br> Wick the Flame is a 2D Platformer that was made in a very short timeframe. We wanted to focus on the aspect of minimal light in a dark environment without making it too bothersome. <br> <br> Below, you'll find examples of what I worked on during this project.
