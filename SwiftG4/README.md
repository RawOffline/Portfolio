## Level Design

| Explanation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| I began by spending some time looking through references of buildings and paths, both unique and mundane. By putting images together into a moodboard, I had a lot of inspiration to work with. Then I started whiteboxing on Unreal Engine. <br> <br> By going through this process, it was much easier to show the artists what I had in mind when building each section, and that made our cooperation so much better. | <img src="/Images/SwiftG4_References.png" alt="References" width="2000" height="auto"> |
| The idea was to have the ability to take multiple paths, to allow the player to figure out their own preferred way of traversing. In this scenario we have two main paths. <br> <br> Blue (Easy) — This path has you running up some stairs then into a hallway. This path is easy but will take longer than the other one. <br> <br> Red (Hard) — This path is tricky. It requires you to do a few jumps, then pull yourself up from a ledge. By landing into the ledge-pull animation, you're slowed down a bit. But if you manage to make a wall run and jump at a good moment, you're able to avoid the ledge-pull, which in turn makes you even faster. | <img src="/Images/SwiftG4_LD1.png" alt="References" width="2000" height="auto"> |
| Red — Continuing with the red path, the player is able to make their way around using high-ground, involving jumps and wall runs. If they drop down, they're able to continue taking the other paths. <br> <br> Blue / Green — If the player took the blue path, they have a variation of different ways to take here while we're introducing our slide/crouch system. | <img src="/Images/SwiftG4_LD2.png" alt="References" width="2000" height="auto"> |
| On the other side of the wall, we have even more variation! Red and Yellow beginning on high ground. <br> <br> Blue and Green continuing from below. | <img src="/Images/SwiftG4_LD3.png" alt="References" width="2000" height="auto"> |

This mentality was used throughout the majority of the Level Design and it lead to quite a fun process for me. The challenging part came during our playtests, I realized that I need to work with clarity. How do I make the intended paths more clear for the player... **Lights!**

| Indeed, using lights and colors was the answer. In the example above, there's a hallway to take on the far left side, but the pillars are blocking the view of the player as they come running in. <br> <br> By using two neon signs, a red _(Stop)_ one on the right and a green _(Go)_ one on the left that looks like arrows pointing to the direction of the hallway, it made things much clearer. | <img src="/Images/SwiftG4_LD4.png" alt="References" width="500" height="auto"> |
| This mentality then allowed me to build more creative and interesting scenes, such as this broken, dark hallway with flickering red lights leading the player to the exit. | <img src="/Images/SwiftG4_Lights.png" alt="References" width="500" height="auto"> |
| Another example of the mentality used above with the flickering lights showing the path. | <img src="/Gifs/SwiftG4_1.gif" alt="References" width="500" height="auto"> |
