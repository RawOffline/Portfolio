Existential Crisis is an experiment of camera angles, inspired by [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil) and [Silent Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill). <br> <br> You get to play as a mannequin who seems to awaken in a foreign location, and they have to find their way out, but things are a bit... odd.
