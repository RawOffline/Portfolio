# _Welcome to my Portfolio_

I'm Rawand, a 26-year-old Game Developer student with a bit of an unconventional background. Before I started coding, I was a dancer. For as long as I can remember, I've been drawn to anything creative, and now I'm channeling that same energy into game development. <br> <br> There's something exciting about the idea of building a game, putting it out there, and watching others experience and enjoy it. That's what drives me. I'm not the most technical person yet, but I'm a fast learner, and I'm always pushing myself to improve. More importantly, I care deeply about my work. I put a lot of passion into what I do, and I feel like my creativity brings a fresh perspective to problem-solving and design. <br> <br> I'm ready to take on new challenges and excited to see where my ideas can take me. <br> <br> Below, you'll find some projects that I've worked on during my time as a Game Developer Student. Make sure to click the link on each header for more in-depth information about the projects and my contribution.
